# The thumbnail cache directory.
# On Windows this defaults to %TEMP%\mpv_thumbs_cache,
# and on other platforms to /tmp/mpv_thumbs_cache.
# The directory will be created automatically, but must be writeable!
# Use absolute paths, and take note that environment variables like %TEMP% are unsupported (despite the default)!

# Automatically generate the thumbnails on video load, without a keypress
# Whether to generate thumbnails automatically on video load, without a keypress
autogenerate=no   # [yes/no]   Default: yes

# Only automatically thumbnail videos shorter than this (in seconds)
# You will have to press T (or your own keybind) to enable the thumbnail previews
# Set to 0 to disable the check, ie. thumbnail videos no matter how long they are
# Defaults to 3600 (one hour)
autogenerate_max_duration=3600

# -- SHA1-sum filenames over this length
# -- It's nice to know what files the thumbnails are (hence directory names)
# -- but long URLs may approach filesystem limits.

# Use mpv to generate thumbnail even if ffmpeg is found in PATH
# ffmpeg is slightly faster than mpv but lacks support for ordered chapters in MKVs,
# which can break the resulting thumbnails. You have been warned.
# Defaults to yes (don't use ffmpeg)
prefer_mpv=yes    # [yes/no]

# Explicitly disable subtitles on the mpv sub-calls
# mpv can and will by default render subtitles into the thumbnails.
# If this is not what you wish, set mpv_no_sub to yes
# Defaults to no
mpv_no_sub=yes  # [yes/no]

# -- Add a "--no-config" to the mpv sub-call arguments

# The maximum dimensions of the thumbnails, in pixels
# Defaults to 200 and 200
thumbnail_width=800
thumbnail_height=800

# The thumbnail count target
# (This will result in a thumbnail every ~10 seconds for a 25 minute video)
thumbnail_count=150

# The above target count will be adjusted by the minimum and
# maximum time difference between thumbnails.
# The thumbnail_count will be used to calculate a target separation,
# and min/max_delta will be used to constrict it.

# In other words, thumbnails will be:
# - at least min_delta seconds apart (limiting the amount)
# - at most max_delta seconds apart (raising the amount if needed)
# Defaults to 5 and 90, values are seconds
min_delta=5
max_delta=90
# 120 seconds aka 2 minutes will add more thumbnails only when the video is over 5 hours long!

# Below are overrides for remote urls (you generally want less thumbnails, because it's slow!)
# Thumbnailing network paths will be done with mpv (leveraging youtube-dl)

# Allow thumbnailing network paths (naive check for "://")
# Defaults to no
thumbnail_network=no        # [yes/no]
# Override thumbnail count, min/max delta, as above
remote_thumbnail_count=60
remote_min_delta=15

# Try to grab the raw stream and disable ytdl for the mpv subcalls
# Much faster than passing the url to ytdl again, but may cause problems with some sites
# Defaults to yes
